Learn Spark

Sean's word counter application to learn spark

- generate a bunch of words in a bunch of files
- return a sorted histogram of the word frequencies
- only considers words containing the letter 'a'

Oddities

- the one-jar does not seem to work, perhaps the manifest needs some additional configuration
